# Farlands of Pain

Farlands of Pain is a mod that applies a scaling multiplier to mobs. You can use a completely custom scaling formula, based on:

- Variables: x_coord, y_coord, z_coord, dist_from_spawn, nearest_player_level, entity_health and current_day variables
- Operators: +, -, *, /, ^, %
- Functions: min, max, clamp, round,  abs, acos, asin, atan, cbrt, ceil, cos, cosh, exp, floor, log, log10, log2, sin, sinh, sqrt, tan, tanh, signum

Planned features:

- GUI to see the current scaling values, for now its just a console command (pain-o-meter)
- Caching the Formula (i kinda doubt that it will be needed)
